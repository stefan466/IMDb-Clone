# Full Stack Movie Database Application

This project was developed as part of the "Script Languages" course at the college. It combines a backend built in Node.js and a frontend developed in Vue.js. The backend handles user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and validation is implemented  both on the server-side and the client-side.
